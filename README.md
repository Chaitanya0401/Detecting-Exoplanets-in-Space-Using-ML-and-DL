Detecting Exoplanets using NASA Exoplanet Achieve 


An exoplanet or an extrasolar planet is a planet that orbits around the axis of a star that is not a part of our solar system. Apart from providing or disagreeing with the scientific theories that have been followed on earth, the exploration of exoplanets has much more to tell. Scientists find it amusing to discover something that no one has ever seen before and can answer many of the unresolved questions. This can help us answer whether there is an Earth-like planet out there and whether life can exist on them. Our agenda is to classify exoplanet candidates from among the various celestial or other space orbiting objects that were captured during the K2 mission. We have applied machine learning and deep learning algorithms along with feature selection and feature extraction techniques and found the RFE followed by fully connected model to be the most efficient one. This model classifies exoplanet candidates with more efficiency.

Dataset used is taken from DES(Dark Energy Survey). Since the dataset is very large, a subset was taken as an input for out model.
